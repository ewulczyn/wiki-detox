The Today show piece stands as a valid, attributable source from a third party. Just do a web search. No other mention on notability outside of that in comments from his group. No widespread mention in the US press, only on blogs, forums and fluff pieces by devotees/fans. Nothing about his art, books or even his life in major news media.

The membership growth slowed after the 1985 controversies in the U.S and since much of the growth has been outside the U.S. A number of observers in and out of Adidam consider 90% attrition in membership over all that period a reasonable estimate.

I've read a bit about feral dogs in general, and the material is against the idea of their packs. More often just pairs or small groups. This is why I asked. I don't know what IPD do naturally.

In the 'History' section, he replaced an entirely duplicated section, duplicating the content immediately above it. He called it an \"Unexplained removal of content\". No content had been removed, it had only been paragraphed ... which he then duplication. \\n\\nHe was obviously in the wrong. He obviously paid no attention to the content. \\n\\nThen he left the erroneous and damaging bad mark which I have asked him politely to apologise, and remove and erase it.\\n\\nIt strikes me it would take a lot less effort just to do so than all this running around.\\n\\nIt is not a \"content issue\", it was bullying. \\n\\nCan you remove and erase it?

       "5    IMO, Wikipedia has become a playground for dedicated fringers to push psuedoscientific and fringe nonsense such as \"Bleep\", among many other subjects, that would never probably not even worth an article in a conventional encyclopedia, nor would the obvious COI, POVing and misapplication of science be tolerated. The primary weakness of Wikipedia has been demonstrated all too well, that it assumes that an article is mainly based on a signficant number of neutral, academic sources and that neutral editors hold the balance in in RFCs and consensus, which is often only the case for more well established subjects. Accuracy comparisons with Britanica, for example, do not accurately present that there is no comparison for the multitude of fring articles no other encylopedia encourages. Fringe topics and claims simply draw dedicated fringe editing support while balanced editors simply don't put the same amount of effort into pointing out the subject is fringe and refuting the nonsense as fr...   \n",

       "7    Hi David. You seem to misunderstand my point. Finally, many weeks after, the Lake County newspaper writes an obituary, at . It clearly states that he was the focus of national media attention in 1985 over unretracted allegations, which the end of BLP due to his death alters what can be added. The Today show piece stands as a valid, attributable source from a third party. Just do a web search. No other mention on notability outside of that in comments from his group. No widespread mention in the US press, only on blogs, forums and fluff pieces by devotees/fans. Nothing about his art, books or even his life in major news media. You may not like it, and I did not say it until the lack of reaction to his death confirmed it, but the 1985 controversy was the most notable thing about him for almost everyone, and his death means that will likely remain the case.

       "8     Your Question On My Talk Page \\n\\nI see you are new to the Da article, welcome! I do not edit there much anymore but I have knowledge and documentation on this subject and will edit if I am concerned about NPOV and factual errors. Regarding your question on my talk page, I have explained this before and here is what I mean. A large number, estimated at around 20,000 people, became members of Adidam at some time from 1972 until now. Of that, let us say around 2,000, or 10%, remain members today. Of those current members, a majority were not members then and were not in the U.S in the 1980s and so could have no direct knowledge on the dissident issue and must hear it from other devotees as history and not necessarily from all sides of this issue. Of those who were involved during the dissident period when certain activities came to light for the first time, a large number are no longer involved today, for a variety of reasons, from lack of desire to conform to the changing requireme...   \n",

There were already close to 1,000 active members attending events at MOA by 1980, and large numbers of them have left since. The membership growth slowed after the 1985 controversies in the U.S and since much of the growth has been outside the U.S. A number of observers in and out of Adidam consider 90% attrition in membership over all that period a reasonable estimate. The point being that even if it was lower than 90%, the views of a large number of former members are not represented by the Adidam position.      \n",

I would however like to mention that the intention was not forum shopping. There was no resolution on the RSN (which I do remember participating in) or RfC (not sure if we had one)that's why I had to seek DRN. I had opened the DRN request to avoid a continuing edit war. However, since it's closure, the other parties began reverting again, without any request for discussion. Rather than edit war, I thought it best to seek your recommendations. Please advise on course of action. Thank you. Regards,      \n",
       "29    Regarding recent ANI  \\n\\nDear ThaddeusB,\\n\\nThank you for your recent adjudication of an ANI filed by user HathaYogin. HathaYogin was recently confirmed to be a sockpuppet at an subsequent SP/I I filed. This user was subsequently blocked indefinitely. However, the patrolling admins did not address the allegation of meatpuppetrythough it was recognized that HathaYogin was an obvious puppetand closed the SP/I in a rush. \\n\\nI recognize the walls of text may be somewhat jarring, but I did attempt later to format it in a more accessible manner. The prime suspect for meatpuppetry has returned to reverting at the original page Dharmachakra, but to avoid continuing an edit war (with predictable consequences) I thought it best to seek your counsel. I should note that well after the SP/I was filed (and long after our revert clash ended) this user filed a bad faith stale edit war ANI against me (though I was able to slip in diffs proving his complicity in time)we both got blocked (as you w...   \n",

Thanks for the links.    \\n\\n right to reply \\n\\nSlipping in those last two comments was borderline, and while I stand by them, I certainly agree you have the right to reply.  It seemed you'd gone in with \"all guns blazing\" at least as much as Elmer Clark had  thus the \"taking it personally\" remark  but if your opinion is otherwise, I certainly won't argue with you about it. —     \n",

       "962   Dogs \\n\\nOne question, how many dogs do you need to make a \"pack\" ... three, four, five ... a dozen? Do they not live in three and fours too?\\n\\nSo, should it be, \"They may live in packs, fives, fours, threes, pairs, or singly\"?\\n\\nThe point I am making is this, you made a canonical statement in your summary, \"no evidence ... etc\" but you did not provide any evidence or reference to sustain it in your edit. \\n\\nCan you do so?\\n\\nThe reason I am writing this is because I spent some time cleaning up and developing the Indian pariah dog topic, which I am sure you know. It's obviously a topic which you have some interest and passion in, perhaps even want to promote, which is a good thing. \\n\\nBut isn't content on the Wikipedia supposed to be supported by references? You may well be right, but you know that's not enough.\\n\\nI am actually interested in these kinds of dogs and would like to know more but there does not seem to be many academic or other reliable reference to support them....   \n",

Likewise, with academic studies. I have no idea what family/pack groups they create, or who or what they pack with. I've read a bit about feral dogs in general, and the material is against the idea of their packs. More often just pairs or small groups. This is why I asked. I don't know what IPD do naturally. Joing wolf packs does not sound right. Wolves are known to kill and eat domestic dogs. They are just too different now. But I know it's not enough to guess on the Wikipedia.\\n\\n I suspect in cities due to crowding and lots of waste, natural patterns for IPDs are corrupted. Thanks.      \n",

In the 'History' section, he replaced an entirely duplicated section, duplicating the content immediately above it. He called it an \"Unexplained removal of content\". No content had been removed, it had only been paragraphed ... which he then duplication. \\n\\nHe was obviously in the wrong. He obviously paid no attention to the content. \\n\\nThen he left the erroneous and damaging bad mark which I have asked him politely to apologise, and remove and erase it.\\n\\nIt strikes me it would take a lot less effort just to do so than all this running around.\\n\\nIt is not a \"content issue\", it was bullying. \\n\\nCan you remove and erase it? I don't want it to be left to be used against me, as already happened.\\n\\nThank you.      \n",
